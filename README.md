# 497s-team-e: LinkUp
GitHub repository for Team E's Scalable Web Systems Project

# a) Routing:
For this repo we are using Nginx in order to control routing between front-end and back-end. This is the industry standard and proper routing is essential for scalability. 
# b) REST API:
We are developing CRUD tasks using Flask to interact with the data structure. This is because of the familiarity our team already has with it. Also Flask has a wide knowledge base in industry.
# c) Connections:
To connect routing to our CRUD tasks we are using uWSGI as the simplest way to connect the two.
# d) Database
MongoDB is a NoSQL database for storing data for our web application. This DB is easy for our team to use and handles a large number of requests very well. MongoDB is useful for scaling.
# e) Back-End
For now our back-end applications are used with Python, Go, and Javascript.
# f) Front-End
Our Front-End UI is designed and implemented with HTML+CSS+JS with utilization of ReactJS
# g) Microservice Architecture
For scalability purposes we are using Docker containers for different parts of our project and we will pull down Dockerfiles to build the images of the containers to satisfy requirements.
