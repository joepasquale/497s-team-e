## Description
This is a Python Flask service that allows the user to export events to their Google calendar. The service connects to the Google API through a client ID and a user login using a React component. The verified OAuth credentials are then passed to the back end, which allows the user to create events in their Google Calendar that they organize using LinkUp via the Google Calendar API.
